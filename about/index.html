      <p>Hi! I’m Lani. I live in Los Angeles, California.</p>

      <p>I graduated from University of California, San Diego with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering,
        concentrating on Software Systems.</p>

      <p>I have always been passionate about building things. They can be furniture from IKEA or a computer program or
        an automated task that I set up on my Android phone. I love that feeling of accomplishment when I finish
        building something. Having enjoyed working on programming assignments from my coursework, I became interested
        in front-end web development. I’ve learned a lot from online resources like <a href="//www.theodinproject.com"
          target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>,
        <a href="//www.codeschool.com" target="_blank">Code School</a> and <a href="//www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a>.
        Check out the <a href="/projects/">projects</a> I’ve made along the way.</p>

      <p>When I’m not making stuff for the web, I watch some cat videos, go on a hike, listen to Jazz Rap, and strum my
        guitar.</p>
