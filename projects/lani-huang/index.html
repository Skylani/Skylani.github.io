<p>This is my personal website built using <a href="//jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and is hosted on <a href="//pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> (YAY!!! It's free hosting!!!). While I design this with minialism in mind, I also add some animations here and there to make it more interesting.</p>
