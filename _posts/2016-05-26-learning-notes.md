Recently, I tried to make this website responsive to screen size so that fonts won't be scaled down.

Even though I added a media query like the following, the website is still not responsive in mobile view.

{% highlight CSS %}
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .blurb {
    text-align: center;
    margin-top: 60px;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}


```js
var x = 10
```

{% highlight language %}

var name = "Alice";
var function = alertMessage(){
  alert("Hello, " + name);
  var name = "Bob";
};
alertMessage();

{% endhighlight %}

`inline code`


> blockquote
