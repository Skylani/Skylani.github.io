Today Evernote has updated. One of the new features is actually something I wish for a long time. It is the ability to zoom in or out a note. On my Macbook air, I can now easily do this by pinching two fingers on the trackpad and resize the whole note in a snap.

Another feature that I love is basically an upgrade of an existing feature, being able to jump to another notebook by press the shortcut command + J. Now pressing this shortcut, we can see a big search box pops up in the middle of the screen, into this we can start typing the name of any notebook or note and start seeing results. The fonts are much bigger. Results include both notebooks and notes.

Small things are the things that matter.
