I learned how to grow some new brain cells from watching a TED Talk. Awesome talk.
<!--more-->

Watch the TED talk [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/sandrine_thuret_you_can_grow_new_brain_cells_here_s_how?language=en){:target="_blank"}.

Here's a list of things I want to remember after watching the talk.

* Adult brains can still generate new neurons in the hippocampus.
* These cells are important for learning, memory, mood and emotion.
* Things that affect neurogenesis (the development of nerve tissues)
    * Diet
        * Increase neurogenesis
            * Resveratrol (red wine): keeps new neurons alive
            * Omega 3 fatty acids (fatty fish like salmon): helps decrease depression
            * Calorie restriction: improve memory capacity
            * Folic acid (dark green veggies, beans, avocado...)
            * Zinc (grass-fed beef, yogurt, lamb...)
            * Flavonoids (dark chocolate, blueberries...)
            * Intermittent fasting (spacing the time between your meals)
            * Caffeine
            * Curcurmin
        * Decrease neurogenesis
            * High saturated fat: depression
            * High sugar
            * Soft diet (no chewing)
            * Ethanol (alcohol except red wine)
            * Vitamin A, B, E defficiency
    * Mood
        * Decrease neurogenesis: depression, stress
    * Activity
        * Increase neurogenesis
          * Higher physical activity (Running, sex â€¦)
          * Learning
        * Decrease neurogenesis:
          * Sleep deprivation
    * Age
        * Decrease neurogenesis when getting older
