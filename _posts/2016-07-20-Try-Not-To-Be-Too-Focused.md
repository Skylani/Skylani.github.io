Whenever I work on something with the computer, I have to use pomodoro technique to remind me to take a break, and try not to have bloodshot eyes.

### Tomato Timer and Automatic Time Tracking

In recent months, I have started using the following three apps together to practice pomodoro technique.

Tools: [Clockwork Tomato](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwizp6SuroDPAhUT9mMKHU9UDp8QFggeMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dnet.phlam.android.clockworktomato%26hl%3Den&usg=AFQjCNHpVpSypedFBSU9x_wPTYytUmS_Dw&sig2=kYgDbiP3UxZ42CWJlt57MA){:target="_blank"} + [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en){:target="_blank"} + [Jiffy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nordicusability.jiffy&hl=en){:target="_blank"}

Clockwork Tomato is a timer app based on Pomodoro technique. There are many other apps that are similar to this one. The only reason why I choose Clockwork Tomato is that it has Tasker integration. And this is also why I use Jiffy, a time tracker.  Using these apps together, I simply start a timer in Clockwork Tomato, then Jiffy can automatically start tracking the corresponding task and stop tracking once it's break time.

Just one tap, I can use two apps. Thanks to Tasker.
