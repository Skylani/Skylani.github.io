  <p>Hi! I’m Lani. I live in Los Angeles, California.</p>

  <p>I’m a recent graduate with BS in Electrical Engineering, concentrating on software systems.</p>

  <p>Having enjoyed working on programming assignments from my coursework, I became interested in front-end web development. I’ve learned a lot from online resources like <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. <a href="/projects" target="_blank">Here</a> are a few things I’ve made along the way.</p>

  <p>When I’m not making stuff for the web, I watch some cat videos, hike, listen to Jazz Rap, and strum my guitar.</p>
