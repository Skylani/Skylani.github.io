<p>A friend messaged me today about a WiFi connection problem. The situation was that she accidentally blocked a cafe’s WiFi network, then her computer (Windows) started showing “can’t connect to this network” when she tried to connect to a school network. Obviously, the network setting had been messed up. Resetting the setting should be able to fix it. Then, I found out  Everything went back to normal once she restarted the computer. Yes, Google is awesome.</p>
